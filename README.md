# Art Marketplace + Job Market Platform

Full-stack Pinterest-inspired image sharing platform — FastAPI + Vue 3 — extended with **roles & audit**, a **Job Market**, a **pin-license Marketplace** (SePay), and an **Admin Ops** console.

**Repo:** [ThietVoTran324/art-marketplace--jobmarket-platform](https://github.com/ThietVoTran324/art-marketplace--jobmarket-platform)

Built to practice production-shaped backend patterns: REST, GraphQL, realtime, Celery, multi-store data, CSRF/session cookies, and sprint-based delivery with smoke scripts.

## Product review

Screenshots from the soft-live demo (assets in [`review_image/`](review_image/)). Story: discover → buy → hire → chat.

### 1. Home / tag filter

Masonry feed with horizontal tag chips (thumbnails + names) for niche browsing.

### 2. Home feed (guest)

Unauthenticated home — curated art pins in a Pinterest-style grid; guest ranking favors engagement (likes → views → comments → saves).

### 3. Pin detail

Full pin view: engagement stats, Save, tags, description, and “More like this”.

## Quick start (Docker)

**Local (full + HMR):**

```bash
docker network create pinterest-network   # once
cp .env.example .env                      # fill secrets; see Marketplace / SePay notes
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| API / health | http://localhost:8000/health |
| Swagger | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Mailhog | http://localhost:8025 |
| PgAdmin | http://localhost:5050 |

**Live / lean demo** (core services only; DB ports not published; FE on `:80` via Nginx):

```bash
docker network create pinterest-network   # once
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend + API (proxied) | http://localhost/ |
| Health (via proxy) | http://localhost/api/health |

Optional stacks (PLG, ELK, exporters, services-monitoring) stay in repo but are not part of local-dev or lean-live commands.

Migrations run with the app image / entrypoint as configured in Compose. After code pulls, restart `fastapi-container` if reload did not pick up changes.

### Grant admin (local)

```bash
docker exec -w /fastapi -e PYTHONPATH=/fastapi fastapi-container \
  python scripts/grant_admin.py <username>
```

Then log out / in so the Vue store reloads roles. Open http://localhost:3000/admin (shield icon in the aside).

### Smoke tests (examples)

```bash
docker exec -w /fastapi -e PYTHONPATH=/fastapi fastapi-container \
  python scripts/smoke_admin_sprint4.py
```

Other smokes: `scripts/smoke_phase0_*.py`, `smoke_jobmarket_*.py`, `smoke_marketplace_*.py`, `smoke_admin_sprint1–3.py`. Marketplace SePay smoke needs `DEV_MODE=true` and `MP_SEPAY_MOCK=true`.

## Async processing

Celery handles non-blocking work such as pin preview / content hash, email, and marketplace order TTL cancellation:

```
API request → Redis/RabbitMQ broker → Celery worker → DB / mail / media
```
